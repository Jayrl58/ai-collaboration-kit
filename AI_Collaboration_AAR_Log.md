## Session: AI Collaboration — 2026-02-16

Friction Observed:
- None significant.

What Worked Well:
- Separating global collaboration doctrine into a dedicated public repository clarified authority boundaries and reduced cross-project coupling.
- The Version Channel model (`stable` tag) balanced control and maintainability better than strict pinning or floating `main`.

Calibration Adjustment Suggested:
- Test Startup Protocol end-to-end using LMR before freezing or snapshotting the collaboration kit.

Action Required:
- Yes (Operational validation required before lifecycle snapshot).
